Tree Traversal Practice

Objective: 
    - The objective of this assignment is to practice implementing and understanding different tree traversal algorithms.

Problem Statement: 
    - You are provided with a binary tree data structure. Your task is to implement various traversal algorithms recursively and analyze their traversal order and output.


                50
           ┌─────┴─────┐
          30           70
     ┌────┴────┐   ┌────┴────┐
    40       20   60         80


Task 1
    - Implement the in-order traversal algorithm for the given binary tree.

Task 2
    - Implement the pre-order traversal algorithm for the given binary tree.

Task 3
    - Implement the post-order traversal algorithm for the given binary tree.

Task 4
    - Test the implemented traversal algorithms on a binary tree and observe the traversal order and output.

Expected Outcomes:
    - Successful implementation of in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal algorithms.
    - Understanding of the traversal order and output for each algorithm.
    - Practice in analyzing and comparing different traversal techniques.
